Disclaimer: While I can provide a comprehensive written response, directly generating a PDF and Python code tailored to your specific system isn't feasible without detailed technical specifications and access to your existing codebase. However, I can offer a general framework and code snippets that can be adapted to your needs.
Here's a breakdown of the key points we've discussed, including potential Python code implementations:
1. Hyper-Secure System Design:
 * Physical Security:
   * Implement robust physical security measures like biometric authentication, surveillance systems, and environmental controls.
   * Consider using Python libraries like OpenCV for computer vision-based authentication or libraries like RPi.GPIO for controlling physical devices like locks and alarms.
 * Digital Security:
   * Employ strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES, RSA) to protect sensitive data.
   * Utilize multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
   * Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to monitor network traffic and block threats.
   * Use libraries like cryptography for encryption, pyOpenSSL for SSL/TLS, and scapy for network packet manipulation.
2. Behavioral Biometrics and AI:
 * Collect and Analyze Behavioral Data: Use Python libraries like pandas and scikit-learn to process and analyze user behavior data.
 * Train Machine Learning Models: Develop machine learning models to identify anomalies and detect potential threats.
 * Implement Real-time Monitoring: Use libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch to create real-time threat detection systems.
3. Quantum Computing and AI Integration:
 * Explore Quantum-Resistant Cryptography: Investigate quantum-resistant algorithms like lattice-based cryptography.
 * Leverage Quantum Machine Learning: Utilize quantum computing frameworks like Qiskit or Cirq to accelerate machine learning models.
4. Ethical Considerations:
 * Privacy: Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA.
 * Accessibility: Design the system to be inclusive and accessible to users of all abilities.
 * Security Risks: Regularly assess and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.
 * Environmental Impact: Consider energy-efficient hardware and software solutions.
Python Code Example: A Simple Behavioral Biometrics System
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Load behavioral data (e.g., keystroke dynamics, mouse movements)
data = pd.read_csv("user_data.csv")

# Split data into features and labels
X = data.drop("label", axis=1)
y = data["label"]

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train a machine learning model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on new data
new_data = ...  # New user data
prediction = model.predict(new_data)

if prediction == "anomalous":
    # Trigger security alert
    print("Anomaly detected!")

Note: This is a simplified example. Real-world applications would involve more complex data processing, machine learning techniques, and security measures.
To generate a PDF, you can use libraries like PyPDF2 to manipulate existing PDFs or ReportLab to create PDFs from scratch.
Remember to consult with security experts and legal professionals to ensure compliance with relevant regulations and ethical guidelines.
